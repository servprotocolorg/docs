## TL;DR

For the impatient, use `hmy cookbook` to see the most common examples & proper arguments.

## Introduction

`hmy` is the offical CLI provided by Harmony. You can use it as a local wallet and as a way to interact with your `Ledger Nano` device. Completely open-source, you can track its development and post any issues encountered and your feature suggestions [here](https://github.com/harmony-one/go-sdk).

{% hint style="info" %}
Be sure to include the output of `$ hmy version` in your bug reports and preferably include the additional output printed when the environment variable HMY\_ALL\_DEBUG is set to true, like so:

`$ HMY_ALL_DEBUG=true hmy transfer ...`
{% endhint %}

## Features

With the `hmy` CLI you can send signed transactions to the Harmony blockchain, check previous transactions and recover keys from previous mnemonics.

## Platforms

* OSX: main development platform
* Linux: tested
* Windows: not tested, but in principle should work under Windows Subsystem for Linux \(WSL\)
