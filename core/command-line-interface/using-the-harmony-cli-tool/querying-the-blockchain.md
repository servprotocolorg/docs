# Querying the blockchain

## Querying the blockchain

The `hmy` provides several subcommands under the `blockchain` subcommand which let you query the blockchain.

## Targeting Specific Shards

As noted elsewhere in these docs, the Harmony blockchain is a _sharded_ blockchain, therefore some commands depend on which _shard_ you target. The shard you target when querying is controlled by the `--node` flag. For example, if a transaction is made between Shard 0 and Shard 1, the transaction receipt must be queried from whichever shard sent the funds. This hash is for a transaction made by a sender in Shard 0 to a receiver in Shard 1:

```text
$ hash='0x599793f313ee17566f8d09728b9d043b8e26135ddce86beeee13f98767d452f7'
$ hmy --node="https://api.s1.b.hmny.io" blockchain transaction-receipt ${hash}
{
  "id": "0",
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": null
}
```

As you can see, Shard 1 does not have that transaction receipt, since the transaction originated from Shard 0. If we switch to the endpoint for Shard 0, we see the expected result:

```text
hash='0x599793f313ee17566f8d09728b9d043b8e26135ddce86beeee13f98767d452f7'
$ hmy --node="https://api.s0.b.hmny.io" blockchain transaction-receipt ${hash}
{
  "id": "0",
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "blockHash": "0x52171a8f3af94f639f1e6044679c4189c3cd088ffe7f1c216ce3089212373af9",

    "transactionIndex": "0x0"
  }
}
```

The only difference was _s1_ vs _s0_ in the URL given to the `--node` flag

`--node="https://api.s1.b.hmny.io"` vs `--node="https://api.s0.b.hmny.io"`
