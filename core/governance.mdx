# Governance

Our goals in 2020 include decentralized development and a transition from governance by the founding team to governance by the community and stakeholders.

We will work on transitioning the network from 32% external nodes to 40% external nodes in Q2 2020 and over time to 100% external nodes.

Our work will be fully transparent in our [Github](https://harmony.one/github) and [Discord](https://harmony.one/discord) and we are inviting external contributors with the goal of 50% external contribution to our development.

We will continue to update our governance mechanism with our community input as we move towards a fully decentralized network.
