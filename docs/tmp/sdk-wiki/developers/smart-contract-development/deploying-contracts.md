# Deploying Contracts using DApp Examples

## Running the admin portal

```text
cd /Users/johnwhitton/projects/sdk/dapp-examples/web
yarn start
```

You will get something like this

```text
$ cd Backend && yarn install && yarn build:server && node build/index.js
[1/4] üîç  Resolving packages...

$ rm -rf build && ./node_modules/.bin/babel src -d build

To deploy a contract select the detail Action on the right

Then select the deploy button and enter your private key, for example

This will show you your balance and then you can press send to deploy the contract
