# Security Overview

The [Security Policy on SERV](https://github.com/servprotocolorg/serv/security/policy)
includes a vulnerability disclosure policy and guidelines for
reporting vulnerabilities in the SERV ecosystem.
It explains the process for reporting and disclosing vulnerabilities through
the use of the [SERV Security](mailto:security@evmos.org) and
how the SERV team handles and resolves reported vulnerabilities.
The contents of the policy help avoiding privacy violations
and keeping information confidential.
Also included are commitments from the SERV team,
such as not pursuing legal action
and working with researchers to disclose issues in a timely manner.
The disclosure process includes steps for verifying
and confirming reported vulnerabilities,
determining their potential impact on the SERV platform,
and patching and disclosing the vulnerability to the public.
The payment process for reported vulnerabilities is also outlined
and instructions for contacting the SERV Security Team are provided.
For more information, visit the Security Policy documentation sites:

* [Ethermint Security Policy](https://github.com/evmos/ethermint/security/policy)

Additionally, SERV has a [Simple Arrangement for Funding Upload (SAFU)](./safu.md).
The SAFU is a simple yet extensible way to specify
a post-exploit policy for whitehats, particularly rewards and distributions.
For more information, visit the [SAFU section](./safu.md).
